      This is a base model for Segment's web page views table. It does some straightforward renaming and parsing of Segment raw data in this table.
      If a page view id has multiple entries in the source table then deduplication is done to keep the row with the earliest `received_at` timestamp.
    columns:
      - name: id
        data_tests:
          - unique
          - not_null
